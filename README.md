UserBundle
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Brammm/UserBundle.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Brammm/UserBundle)

A User bundle that does what I want it do.

## What it does

At the moment, this bundle doesn't do much. It provides a basic User entity that will allow users to log in via email (no usernames!).

It has a data fixture to generate some default users (as well as the default 'admin@example.com' admin).
